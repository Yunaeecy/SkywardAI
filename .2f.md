# ðŸª± "{:.2f}"

"{:.2f}" is a string formatting syntax in Python that specifies the number of decimal places to display when formatting a floating-point number. The ".2f" specifies that the number should be formatted with two decimal places. For example, if you have a floating-point number x = 3.14159265, you can limit it to two decimal points using the format function as follows: y = "{:.2f}".format(x), which will return the value 3.14. Alternatively, you can use the f-string method to format the number as follows: y = f"{x:.2f}", which will also return the value 3.14[\
