# ðŸ‰‘ two types of group work

Two approaches concerning learning in group are of interest, namely _cooperative learning_ and _collaborative learning_. There seems to be a certain amount of confusion concerning how these concepts are to be interpreted and used, as well as what they actually signify. Often the conceptions are used synonymously even though there are some differentiations. Cooperative group work is usually considered as a comprehensive umbrella concept for several modes of student active working modes ([Johnson and Johnson, 1975](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00558/full#B29); [Webb and Palincsar, 1996](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00558/full#B38)), whereas _collaboration_ is a more of an exclusive concept and may be included in the much wider concept cooperation ([Hammar Chiriac, 2011a](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00558/full#B23),[b](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00558/full#B24)). Cooperative learning may describe group work without any interaction between the students (i.e., the student may just be sitting next to each other; [Bennet and Dunne, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00558/full#B5); [Galton and Williamson, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00558/full#B13)), while collaborative learning always includes interaction, collaboration, and utilization of the groupâ€™s competences ([Bennet and Dunne, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00558/full#B5); [Galton and Williamson, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00558/full#B13); [Webb and Palincsar, 1996](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00558/full#B38)).
