# üç° ArrayList & LinkedList

ArrayList is a better choice when there is a need for fast access to elements, and when the list will not be modified frequently[2](https://www.scaler.com/topics/arraylist-vs-linkedlist/)[4](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/differences-between-arraylist-and-linkedlist-in-java)[5](https://www.baeldung.com/java-arraylist-linkedlist). LinkedList is a better choice when there is a need for frequent modifications, such as adding or removing elements from the list[2](https://www.scaler.com/topics/arraylist-vs-linkedlist/)\
