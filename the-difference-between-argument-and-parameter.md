# üçí The difference between argument and parameter

Arguments and parameters are two terms that are often used interchangeably, but they have different meanings in programming. Here are the differences between argument and parameter:

* Parameter: A parameter is a variable in a function definition that acts as a placeholder for a value that will be passed to the function when it is called. It is a part of the function's signature and defines the type and number of values that the function expects to receive.
* Argument: An argument is a value that is passed to a function when it is called. It is the actual value that is assigned to the parameter of the function. Arguments are passed to a function in the order that the parameters are defined.

In summary, a **parameter** is a variable that is **defined in a function**, while an <mark style="color:red;">**argument**</mark> is the value that is <mark style="color:red;">**passed to that parameter when the function is called**</mark>.

## "def display\_results(self) -> None:" and "def display\_results(self):"

the former specifies <mark style="color:purple;">**the return type**</mark> of the function, while the latter does not. **The "-> None"** in the first example indicates that the function <mark style="color:green;">**does not return anything.**</mark>
