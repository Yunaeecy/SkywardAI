# üêç print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

The `{e}` in the code `except Exception as e: print(f"An error occurred: {e}")` is a **string formatting syntax** in Python that allows you to **insert the value of a variable into a string**. In this case, the value of the caught exception is inserted into the string to print an error message along with the exception details.

It's important to note that if you try to print `{e}` outside of the try-except block, you will get a `NameError` as `e` is not defined in the current scope. This is because `e` is a variable that is assigned the caught exception in the try-except block, and it only exists within that block.\
An example of how to use string formatting to insert the value of a variable into a string:\


```python
# define a variable
x = 42

# use string formatting to insert the value of x into a string
print(f"The value of x is {x}")
```
