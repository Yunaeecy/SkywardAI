# âš™ Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion is an advanced AI text-to-image synthesis algorithm that can generate very coherent images based on a text prompt.

&#x20;It is commonly used for generating artistic images but can also generate images that look more like photos or sketches. Stable Diffusion is good at generating faces and realistic 3D scenes.

&#x20;It is also good at mashing up concepts to create entirely novel images.&#x20;

Stable Diffusion is entirely <mark style="color:red;">**open source**</mark>, and users can even train their own models based on their own dataset to get it to generate exactly the kind of images they want.
