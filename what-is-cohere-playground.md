# üçí What is Cohere playground?

It is a visual interface for users to test Cohere's large language models without a single line of code. To familiarize yourself with the endpoints, you are recommended to click the **Generate** or **Calculate** button on each endpoint and observing the outputs. Use the playground to test your use cases and when you're ready to start building, simply click **Export Code** to add Cohere's functionality to your application.
